            <p>
                A vagrant was crossing a run-down town, <br>
                he wanted to take a closer look. <br>
                There were bodies piled up <br>
                so their blood lingers on the floor. <br>
                <br>
                The hamlet has undergone a war. <br>
                Now they're above and below. <br>
                Faith is just a lie. <br>
                <br>
                I'm a plaything of the wealthy, <br>
                they watched me as I bled to death. <br>
                Please take me out <br>
                of this eternal damnation. <br>
                Don't let the people know about... <br>
                <br>
                Aftermath of bloodbath, <br>
                aftermath of bloodbath, <br>
                aftermath of bloodbath. <br>
                Since their god has gone. <br>
                <br>
                He was a skillful huntsman, <br>
                his son was in his tenth year. <br>
                Trying to get him out of here <br>
                a bullet pierced his heart. <br>
                <br>
                An instant before the storm rolled <br>
                they sealed their eternal love. <br>
                <br>
                Why the shafts of devine light are gone? <br>
                Surely they're bounded by an imp. <br>
                How dare you cut'em down? <br>
                Though it's absurd, <br>
                you could never feel it. <br>
                <br>
                Oh god, come back! <br>
                Return it to what <br>
                it used to be. <br>
                <br>
                Let the bodies sing... <br>
                <br>
                I'm a plaything of the wealthy, <br>
                they watched me as I bled to death. <br>
                <br>
                I'm a plaything of the wealthy, <br>
                they watched me as I bled to death, <br>
                in this... <br>

                aftermath of bloodbath, <br>

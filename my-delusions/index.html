            <p>
                Socializing is shattering my head. <br>
                No religion, there's no one left to blame. <br>
                <br>
                No races, no horses to ride.  <br>
                No companion, all flowers shrivelled up. <br>
                <br>
                Should I speak my mind? <br>
                Would my words sound somewhat appealing? <br>
                I look like a dead body but I am living still. <br>
                <br>
                Can they see what I feel <br>
                when I'm standing next to them? <br>
                I'm the odd one out, aren't I? <br>
                <br>
                No rejection, still no mention too. <br>
                Could I be born again? <br>
                Fighting wildly against my soul. <br>
                <br>
                Lock me inside a machine  <br>
                to change my eyes and fix my lips, <br>
                to change the way I learn and speak, <br>
                and I'll be your desired fusion. <br>
                <br>
                I want new teeth and feet <br>
                so they will say: "Oh, you're so sweet". <br>
                I'm crazy now, no sanity, <br>
                the pressure needs to stop. <br>
                <br>
                Don't get me wrong, dear mirror. <br>
                I still am my true self, I swear. <br>
                <br>
                It was not born by chance <br>
                This is who I wanna be <br>
                But is it me the one who is staring back? <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm drivin' up to nowhere. <br>
                The wind blowing my hair. <br>
                I may not come back <br>
                This is my new home. <br>
                <br>
                I don't need no company <br>
                I only want to stay with <br>
                my wheels on the road. <br>
                <br>
                I left my town with no chance <br>
                to be the same again. <br>
                Sometimes I miss my old bed <br>
                I found another way to dream. <br>
                <br>
                Pride, pride is the only thing I love. <br>
                Ride, ride this on my own. <br>
                <br>
                My pretty little Harley <br>
                you're looking so freaking good <br>
                with my Bird lather jacket <br>
                and don't forget my boots. <br>
                <br>
                I don't need no company <br>
                I only want to stay with <br>
                my wheels on the road. <br>
                <br>
                Pride, pride is the only thing I love. <br>
                Ride, ride this on my own. <br>
                <br>
                I'm between the meadows <br>
                setting my long way. <br>
                Some ask me where I'm going. <br>
                I'm gonna take back my friends. <br>
                <br>
                I donna shoot in vain, honey. <br>
                Let me rock it when I use <br>
                my microphone and only shout... <br>
                <br>
                Oh, my wheels on the road. <br>
                Oh, my wheels on the road. <br>
                Oh, my wheels on the road. <br>
                Oh, my wheels on the road.  <br>
